## App Infrastructure

*Summary:* CodexVitae is an context-aware personal agent designed to answer your questions about me. It uses retrieval-augmented generation to provide accurate answers about my skills, academic achievements, work experience, projects, and character.

*Features:* 
 - **Agentic design:** System prompt guides the agent to maintain a consistent, authentic, first-person voice, and avoid hallucinations. If information is missing, it suggests contacting me directly.
 - **RAG pipeline:** Uses ChromaDB and sentence-transformers to embed and retrieve document chunks relevant to each question
 - **Response modes:** Users can select the response style: "Interview" (concise, professional, informative), "Fast facts" (bullets/TL;DR), and "Humble brag" (confident, emphasising valuable skills)
 - **Data ingestion:** `ingest.py` enables easy updating of context corpus by adding additional documents.

*Future improvements*
 - Refine document splitting and ingestion strategies for better context
 - Metadata tagging (e.g. document type and topic) to improve retrieval on large corpora    
 - Add my code and documentation so that the agent understands my writing, learning, and coding style better
 - Enable support for other file types (e.g. PDF)
